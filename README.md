# aceup

Public scripts to bootstrap the ACE installation process

## New User Setup

Run the following commands to get your new system set up to work at ACT3

> Linux and macOS only, requires Homebrew and Git to be installed.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/act3-ace/aceup/main/act3-login)"
brew install ace-tools
ace-kubectl-plugins
```

## ACT3 Login

The ACT3 Login script automatically logs a user into the standard ACT3 services. It also sets up secure credential storage for your system.

> Linux and macOS only, requires Homebrew and Git to be installed.

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/act3-ace/aceup/main/act3-login)"
```

<!-- If you use zsh as your shell on macOS, run this command

```bash
/bin/zsh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/act3-ace/aceup/main/act3-login)"
``` -->

### Caveats

1. ACT3 Login configures tools installed by Homebrew. Alternate installations of the same tools configured by ACT3 Login will produce unexpected behavior after running the script.
2. ACT3 Login is not guaranteed to work for WSL2.

### Troubleshooting

> My previous token is still stored when I check the keyring.

Try relaunching the keyring GUI, it might not have updated yet.

> I am getting this error during Git credential setup: `git: 'credential-osxkeychain' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.`

You may be using an alternate installation of Git.

1. Check what `git` executable you are using: `which -a git`
2. If there are multiple entries, run `brew uninstall git` and then rerun ACT3 Login

> I am getting this error during Kubernetes secret creation: `error: unable to load root certificates: unable to parse bytes as PEM block`

You may have an out of date certificate in your cluster configuration. Back up your `~/.kube/` directory, delete the `~/.kube/` directory, and rerun ACT3 Login.
